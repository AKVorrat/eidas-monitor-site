        Our concept note outlines the vision behind a new transparency platform for the EU’s digital 
        identity system. It highlights the key risks, the need for independent oversight, and how we

A new kind of digital infrastructure is taking shape — one that aims to make the opaque systems behind Europe's digital identity wallet visible, understandable, and accountable. We're working on a platform that will expose how personal data is requested, by whom, and for what reason — helping civil society, researchers, and individuals make sense of this rapidly expanding ecosystem. Something powerful is coming soon — and it’s designed to protect your rights.
